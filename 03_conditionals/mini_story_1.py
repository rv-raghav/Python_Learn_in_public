#Customer Discount Eligibility
# Youâ€™re building a logic module for a billing system. Based on customer data, you need to evaluate whether they are eligible for a discount or a senior citizen privilege using if statements.

# Tasks:

# Create three variables:

# customer_name = "Amit"

# customer_age = 24

# total_purchase = 1200

# If total_purchase is greater than 1000, print "Eligible for discount".

# If customer_age is greater than or equal to 60, print "Senior Citizen".

total_purchase = 1200

if total_purchase > 1000:
    print("Eligible for discount")
if customer_age >= 60:
